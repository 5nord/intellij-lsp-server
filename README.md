# intellij-lsp-server
A plugin for IntelliJ IDEA that embeds a Language Server Protocol server, allowing other editors to use IntelliJ's features.

## Caveats
- Only targets Java for now, though there is no reason the plugin cannot have awareness of other languages.
- Tested primarily with Emacs' lsp-mode.
- Alpha-quality, and probably really unstable.
